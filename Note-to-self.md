I scoped and designed a full-stack project to simulate an end to end workflow. 
On the backend, I chose Django for user management. 
One the frontend, I used React + Vite for the UI. 
Along the way, I learned the importance of app organization in Django.
I made the mistake of having AI replace my understanding and it did a lot of the work for me, instead of helping to review the code.
To correct for this, I am rescoping the project, and simplifying the architecture to build my understanding.
